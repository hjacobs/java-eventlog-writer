=========================

Library to make PostgreSQL stored procedures(SProcs) available through simple Java "SProcService" interfaces including automatic object serialization and deserialization (using typemapper and convention-over-configuration).

Supports horizontal database sharding, advisory locking for guaranteed single node execution, configurable statement timeouts and PostgreSQL type support for enums and hstore.

Dependencies:
-------------

 * standard Maven dependences (Spring, Postgres, Guava, ..), see pom.xml for details

How to run integration tests
----------------------------

* install local postgres cluster running on 5432 with postgres/postgres superuser
* create zalando_test database on your localhost postgres cluster
* run integration tests (JUnit tests with database access):

    mvn clean test -Pintegration-test

Known issues:
-------------

* PostgreSQL JDBC driver does not honor identical type names in different schemas, this may lead to issues if typemapper is used where types are present with equal name in more than one schema (this problem is solved now with the commit [3ca94e64d6322fa91c477200bfb3719deaeac153](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/3ca94e64d6322fa91c477200bfb3719deaeac153) to [pgjdbc](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/) driver)
* PostgreSQL domains are not supported as for now
* PostgreSQL `hstore` type is mapped from and to `Map<String,String>`, there is no way to use `Map` of different types for now
* Two different datasources with the same jdbc URL and different search path might not work properly when we have types with the same name.
* Sprocwrapper is relying on the search path to resolve conflicting types with the same name (right now, we are not checking the schema). If one specifies the schema of the stored procedure's return type, sprocwrapper might end up using the wrong one because it will use the search path to resolve the conflict.
