zomcat-ws: Zomcat Webservice/CXF Support Classes
================================================

Usage:

Include the following line in your project's cxf.xml file to get the default CXF bus configuration (including flowID and wsauth):

    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/zomcat-ws/cxf.xml"/>

If you need a custom bus configuration (e.g. to add additional interceptors), you can only import the bean definitions:

    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/zomcat-ws/cxf-nobus.xml"/>
    <cxf:bus>
        <!-- your bus config here -->
    </cxf:bus>
    

To enable WS authorization you must configure the following appconfig properties:

    wsauth.enable = true
    wsauth.roles.allowed = [...]
    wsauth.roles.denied = [...]

To use "logging-only" mode additionally set:

    wsauth.level = LOGGING_MODE
