TODO
====

short-term
- provide typical SVN-Layout (trunk, branches, tags) to make it possible to release with mvn-release-plugin
- divide existing code in 'eclipselink-specific' and 'domain-support' (packages 'domain' and 'repository' are independent of eclipselink and are not needed when using spring-data-jpa)
- a multi-module-project would make it possible to add separate extensions

long-term
- check pom.xml to use 'mvn-release'
- One-Button-Click-Release per Jenkins, I know that is possible ;-)
